# Project architecture

## Context and goal
Short: what the system does and why it exists.

## Engineering principles
See `docs/principles.md` (required standard): speed without reinventing the wheel, flexibility without unnecessary dependencies, secrets never end up in git/image.

## Components
- Frontend:
- Backend/API:
- Workers/Jobs:
- Storage:

## Integrations
- external services
- protocols / key contracts

## Environments
- local/dev
- test/stage
- prod

## Deploy
- how we build
- how we run (docker compose)
- how we proxy behind the edge

## Observability
- logs
- metrics
- alerts

## Risks and decisions
- list 3–5 key risks and how we address them
