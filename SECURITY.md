# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability
If you believe you have found a security vulnerability:
- Do **not** open a public GitHub issue.
- Prefer a private report to the maintainer.

Include:
- affected component / endpoint
- reproduction steps or PoC
- potential impact
- any suggested fix

## Handling secrets
- Never paste secrets (tokens/passwords/private keys) into issues, PRs, or chat.
- Secrets must never be committed to git and must never be baked into Docker images.
